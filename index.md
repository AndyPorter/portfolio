## Portfolio

- [View housing development](/view-housing-development/index.md) 

## Status
July 2019
Contains only the latest service I've been a designer on.

### Todo?

- add previous services.
- add some contextual information about the background to the design, the users and their needs, the problem trying to solve, etc.
- add some useful lessons learnt or problems faced, things not achieved - as a reminder.
- consider making a seperate repo as a CV, and perhaps some contextual information should go there instead.
- create my own jekyll theme for this repo

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
