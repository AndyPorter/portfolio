# view housing development

For everyone involved in the build, sale and purchase of a new property.

Publishing information HM Land Registry knows - the plan of the housing development, and information about the plots/properties in that housing development, so there is a single up-to-date view of information about the development and plots.

Information published by HM Land Registry gives assurance to all parties that the property beind built and sold will be registrable.  Increasiong confidence in the sale/purchase - that the legal details to be registered will be right before completion.

Information should be in the public domain, unless there is a reason not to.  The sites are publically viewable, and sales offices exist, and housing developers publish marketing information about the sites - inclusding user firendly plans for the purposes of selling properties

Each housing development should have a permanent URL that always gives any user access to the latest information, and status.  The link to the hosuing development is shared with the housing developer upon the Land Regsitry checking a development plan, for distribution as they see fit.

Housing developments or individual plots should be discoverable from a search engine (google-able).  This is the entry point for people who do not have the link.

We found that the service shown here + notifications if details of a plot changed would be the minimun viable service for conveyancers.


## Why does this service need to exist?

Users and their needs are listed further down, but research found that:

- often the buyers conveyancers did not have the plan the housing developer had drawn, or the lastest version of the plan.  They also often didn't have the address of the property.
- Housing developers have to distribute copies to many conveyancers and other parties
- Many copies of the plan exist, and not everyone has a copy - people are unsure as to which is the latest copy and if they have it.
- Ordnance Survey don't have a copy of the plan, and do survey features that are intended to be temporary as a permanent feature
- Buyers and lenders usually do not see the plan
- HM Land Registry - in registering properties needs users to refer to the plot they are buying.  73% of OS2 forms (reserving priority) have an attached plan, when advice is to not attach a plan (beause users are unsure/need assurance).  Additional OS2 forms are submitted with the sole purpose of getting HM Land Registry to confirm what the latest plan is.  Over half of the applications do not contain the plan approved date (the plan version).  Applications to register the deed contain plans supplied by the conveyancer that are wrong and hand drawn, not drawn to scale.
- Examples of property plans being registered incorrectly were found, and situations where the buyer had a problem with a purchase that would have been solved more easily if they could have seen the plan themselves
- Registers of Scotland have a very similar service, which the whole industry says increases confidence in the build/sale/purchase/registration process.
